### As per the image How to tell this is a phishing email: 

## A - The first thing to notice in this CEO phishing email example is the sender’s email doesn’t match the email in their email signature.

## B - There are also grammatical errors and an unusual tone of voice—e.g., the CEO likely wouldn’t use formal language like “please find enclosed” to a CFO with whom he works closely.

## C - The classic tactic of urgency is employed, giving the recipient little time to consider the request.
